# Pig-Game

Objective: To be the first player to reach 100 points.

The first player rolls the dice. If he rolls as 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, then the score is added accordingly.

If he did not roll a 1, the player can decide to roll again. If he again rolls a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, he adds that number to his previous score. If he rolls a 1, he earns no score and immediately passes the dice to the next player.

When a player doesnâ€™t roll a 1, he can decide to continue rolling and adding the points from each roll to his total score for that turn.  Or he can hold onto his points and pass the dice to the next player.

However!

If the player rolls a 1, he loses all his points and must pass the dice to the next player.

Play continues in this manner until one player reaches a score of 100.
